    'TODO: Possibly Comment the code so its not hell to read. BTW tommy, if you type 3 ' above a sub or function or whatever it will automake a 
    ' summary. It makes it so that if you add a description for the paramaters you can see the descriptions when using that function. Very useful.
    ' you can see an example of this in the EmployeeServer class for the MakeNewRequest function.

    'manager is? Need some way to bs this.
